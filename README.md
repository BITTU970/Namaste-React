2. Difference between Library and Framework?
   ### Library:
   - Library is one that can be applied to any part of our existing app.
   - It does not INVERT THE CONTROL since the control is in the hands of the programmer who can use it where and when required
   - React is a library since it can be applied to any portion of our app like navbar or header etc.

    ### Framework:
   - Framework is a whole full-fledged program that is used to build a whole app.
   - It INVERTS THE CONTROL since it provides the developer some places to plug in their code. It calls that code only as needed.
   - React is not a framework but a library.
